1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I came here when I was six years old, that's almost 90 years ago.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I walked up that road along there with my mother and father.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
They were going to the Victoria and Albert and I'm sure it was my father who was wise

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and who knew that I would be bored to tears with the art exhibition that they wanted to see.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I said, look, why don't you go over the road there and see those steam engines they've got there.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So Strand School, bad start, but has improved considerably since half term.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I always regarded school as a kind of prison you were sent to for being young.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I always wanted to be a scientist from at least as early as six years old when I first entered this place.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And I soon discovered that you're not allowed into a laboratory until you have that piece of paper saying you've got a degree.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So I thought, well, I'll just have to soldier on and put up with all this awful schooling.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You're best known probably for Gaia theory. How's that changed in your mind over the past decades?

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Very little. It stayed the same thing that it was when it came into my mind in the Jet Propulsion Laboratories in NASA.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Only three years after NASA had been founded.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Where do cities come in?

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The nearest model to us in the animal world, the nearest model is the ants and termites, little insects like that.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,000
They learned very early on that the most efficient way of living is to live in a city they call a nest,

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
where there can even be great air conditioning towers.

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Instead of talking about saving the planet, air conditioning the planet,

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
to air condition a city to the temperature you want is quite easy compared with the planet.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Do you think we should give up trying to save the planet then?

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Exactly. Oh yes. That was a nice little lady, that one.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:14,000
In 1964 I decided that I'd spend the rest of my life as an independent scientist and set up my own lab in a cottage in the village.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I knew I'd have to make my own equipment and it better be good equipment that you make and that requires good instruments to build it with.

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And as you can see there it is well used.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Which inventions are most dear to you or do you feel were most important in your life?

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Almost impossible to say. I wouldn't classify them any more than I classify people according to their value or importance in life.

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
They represent challenges, excitements, adventures.

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This is the electron capture device here, correct?

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yes.

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Tell us what you found with this.

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Well I found that the CFCs were adding up in the atmosphere of the world without any apparent loss.

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And that the amount that was adding up was almost exactly the amount that industry was releasing into the atmosphere.

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I had the chance to go on a ship down to Antarctica and that was my main motivation.

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I love sea journeys and I thought oh great I can go down and I can measure the CFCs in the atmosphere all the way from Britain all the way to Antarctica.

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And that way estimate what the global atmospheric concentration of the gases are.

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So I need an apparatus to do it.

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And that took me about three evenings in the country doing that.

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Are you at the point where you want to give over the inventing and the science to others or are you working on something now?

39
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:01,000
No, no. My father was inventing when he was two weeks from dying so I only hope to follow his example.
